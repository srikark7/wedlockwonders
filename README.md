# Wedlock Wonders

An all-in-one online wedding management platform designed to simplify planning and make your big day stress-free.

---

Background: Traditional wedding planning involves a fragmented approach with multiple 
vendors and manual management, leading to inefficiencies and potential errors. Managing 
venues, catering, decorations, and orchestras separately often becomes overwhelming for 
clients. 
Problem Statement: The absence of a centralized platform for organizing wedding-related 
services makes the process cumbersome. Clients face difficulties coordinating vendors, while 
vendors struggle with exposure and streamlined workflows. A digital solution can bridge these 
gaps effectively. 
The primary goal is to simplify wedding planning by: 
1. Providing clients with an intuitive interface to select venues, catering, decorations, 
and orchestras. 
2. Equipping vendors with tools to manage their services efficiently. 
3. Ensuring administrators have oversight for fraud prevention and smooth operations. 
Scope of the Project 
o For Clients: 
o Browsing and booking services seamlessly. 
o Tracking preferences and making secure payments. 
o For Vendors: 
o Effortlessly registering and managing services. 
o Accessing analytical tools to optimize performance. 
o For Admins: 
o Monitoring fraud detection and maintaining system integrity 
o Scaling platform operations for enhanced functionality.
